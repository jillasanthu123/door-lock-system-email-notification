# Door-lock-system-email-notification

This is my mini project in my B.Tech 

Thee main theme of my project is security 
The door will check the card with the help of RFID scanner and then check the data from the code and take further step 

if the UID matches 
---- the door will open and it will send a mail to the owner or the user 

if the UID does not match 
---- the door will not open 
---- the buzzer will ring
---- the user will get alert

in future we can add the camara and capture the image when any unauthorized person to unlock the door 
and give some alerts to nearest police station or the surrouindings
